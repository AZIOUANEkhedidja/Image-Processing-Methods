# Image Processing Methods

This project implements various image processing techniques using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to select images and apply different image processing algorithms. The following methods are included in the application:

## Features

- **Image Conversion**: Convert images between different color spaces such as RGB, HSV, YCbCr, and Grayscale.
- **Histogram Generation**: Generate histograms for color channels and grayscale images, including cumulative histograms.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter that allows easy navigation and operation.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Utilizes OpenCV for efficient image processing tasks.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **RGB to HSV and vice versa**
- **RGB to Grayscale and vice versa**
- **RGB to Binary**
- **YCbCr Conversion**
- **Histogram Calculation**: Includes both regular and cumulative histograms for visual analysis of pixel intensity distributions.

## Usage

1. **Select an Image**: Click the "Choose an Image" button to select an image file from your system.
2. **Apply Processing**: Use the conversion and histogram menus to apply the desired image processing operations.
3. **View Results**: The processed images and histograms will be displayed in the application window.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
